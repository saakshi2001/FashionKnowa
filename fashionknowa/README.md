Hosted at https://fashionknowa.herokuapp.com/

## Inspiration
In this era, it is important to be mindful of the environment and the impact we have on it. Hence, the idea of FashionKnowa was born. We help identify what clothes are made of sustainable material so everyone can shop ethically.


## What it does
Being conscious about the clothes you buy can help cut down your carbon footprint and have a positive impact on the environment. We help you shop ethically for a better tomorrow.

## How we built it
We built FashionKnowa using HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Flask as the backend framework. We also used OpenCV and PyTeserract to extract information from the images uploaded.

## Challenges we ran into
Apart from being short on time and this being our first hackathon, we struggled to find a proper method to web scrape and extract the fabric data from the vast variety of websites.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the fact that we successfully managed to complete most functionalities of our website and host it on Heroku. We also learnt multiple technologies in a short span of time.

## What we learned
We learnt a lot about teamwork and managing our time efficiently. We enjoyed working under the pressure and time crunch of a large scale hackathon like ShellHacks. The workshops conducted were especially helpful since all the mentors provided tips and tricks. The internship opportunities will also be very helpful in advancing our careers.

## What's next for FashionKnowa
We plan on implementing our own OCR model that can recognise images captured via camera and display them on the screen so the user can cross-verify the input. We aim to shed light on ethical fashion, thereby urging companies to promote sustainability.
